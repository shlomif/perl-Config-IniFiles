Documentation tidyup

Revision 2.39  2003/12/06 07:54:21  wadg
[By Proxy for domq]
* Encapsulation of internal data structures even for use within the
  class: e.g. ReadConfig() and the TIEHASH interface operate using accessor
  methods on $self. Causes massive simplification of the code.

* TIEHASH interface made load-on-demand. Order of each() in TIEHASH
  same as configuration file's order (i.e. $self->Sections() and
  $self->Parameters()).

* push() and exists() methods

* -allowempty and -deltas parameters to new()

* support for loading config from a SCALAR reference. Unfortunately
  this also requires a small patch to IO::Scalar, whose author has yet
  to respond to my email

* ->{myparms} and ->{mysects} fields, supporting -delta=>1 option to
  WriteConfig()

* _assert_invariants() method (used only in t/01basic.t and
  t/02weird.t, maybe should be packaged otherwise)

Small documentation change in IniFiles.pm - pod2* was choking on misplaces
=item tags. And I regenerated the README
The main reason for this release is that the MANIFEST in the 2.17 version was
missing one of the new test suite files, and that is included in this
re-release.

Revision 1.7  2000/09/21 11:19:17  rbowen
Mostly documentation changes. I moved the change log into the POD rather
than having it in a separate Changes file. This allows people to see the
changes in the Readme before they download the module. Now I just
need to make sure I remember to regenerate the Readme every time I do
a commit.


1.6 September 19, 2000 by JW, AS
* Applied several patches submitted to me by Jeremy and Alex.
* Changed version number to the CVS version number, so that I won't
have to think about changing it ever again. Big version change
should not be taken as a huge leap forward.

0.12 September 13, 2000 by JW/WADG
* Added documentation to clarify autovivification issues when
creating new sections
* Fixed version number (Oops!)

0.11 September 13, 2000 by JW/WADG
* Applied patch to Group and GroupMembers functions to return empty
list when no groups are present (submitted by John Bass, Sep 13)

0.10 September 13, 2000 by JW/WADG
* Fixed reference in POD to ReWriteFile. changes to RewriteConfig
* Applied patch for failed open bug submitted by Mordechai T. Abzug Aug 18
* Doc'd behavior of failed open
* Removed planned SIG testing from test.pl as SIGs have been removed
* Applied patch from Thibault Deflers to fix bug in parameter list
when a parameter value is undef

0.09
Hey! Where's the change log for 0.09?

0.08
2000-07-30  Adrian Phillips  <adrianp@powertech.no>

* test.pl: Fixed some tests which use $\, and made those that try
to check a non existant val check against ! defined.

* IniFiles.pm: hopefully fixed use of $\ when this is unset
(problems found when running tests with -w).  Similar problem with
$/ which can be undefined and trying to return a val which does
not exist. Modified val docs section to indicate a undef return
when this occurs.

0.07
Looks like we missed a change log for 0.07. Bummer.

* Updated test.pl file
* Fixed bug in multiline/single line output
* Fixed bug in default handling with tie interface

again.

0.02 Tue Jun 13, 2000 by RBOW
* Fixed bug reported by Bernie Cosell - Sections, Parameters,
and GroupMembers return undef if there are no sections,
parameters, or group members. These functions now return
() if the particular value is undefined.
* Added some contributed documentation, from Alex Satrapa, explaining
how the internal data structure works.
* Set up a project on SourceForge. (Not a change, but worth
noting).
* Added Groups method to return a list of section groups.
