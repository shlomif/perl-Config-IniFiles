Version 2.75    ( Fri May 25 15:25:29 IDT 2012 )
------------------------------------------------

* Add "=encoding utf8" to the POD of lib/Config/IniFiles.pm

Version 2.71:   ( Wed May  2 10:59:04 IDT 2012 )
------------------------------------------------

with a predictable name ("${filename}-new") which opens the door for potential
exploits.

* Now requiring List::MoreUtils (for any() and other functions), File::Temp
and File::Basename .

------------------------------------------------

* Fix the test dependency (in the new t/31comments_with_spaces.t test)
on IO::stringy (now writing it to a file).
    - This caused some CPAN Testers failures such as:
        - http://www.cpantesters.org/cpan/report/c16b9978-7f40-11e1-9d6f-f6dbfa7543f5

* Modernized some of the open() calls in the test files.
    - three args open, lexcial file handles, etc.

Version 2.69:   ( Thu Apr  5 12:05:46 IDT 2012 )
------------------------------------------------

* Fix https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3388382&group_id=6926&atid=106926
    - "Trailing comments with whitespace are not recognised"
    - Thanks to briconaut for the report and to rbowen for the patch and test.

* Add the method ->OutputConfigToFileHandle which is a more explicit and
safer version of ->OutputConfig.
    - ->OutputConfig now uses it.
    - all existing tests pass, and a new test was added to
    t/15store-and-retrieve-here-doc-terminator.t .

* Started refactoring the code.
    - Expand tabs to spaces.
    - many other small changes.

Version 2.68:   ( Tue Jun 21 22:14:39 IDT 2011 )
------------------------------------------------

* Typo correction: https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=69003

Version 2.67:   ( Tue Jun 21 14:55:07 IDT 2011 )
------------------------------------------------

* Made sure that parameters with empty values will be written to the file.
    - Fixes https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=68554 .

Version 2.66:   ( Sat Jan 29 18:28:53 IST 2011 )
------------------------------------------------

* Add support for the handle_trailing_comment option to support trailing
comments at the end of a param=value line.
    - Fixes https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=43843 .
    - Original patch by Peter Xu.
    - Some comments and corrections of the patch by Shlomi Fish (the current
    Config-IniFiles maintainer.)

Version 2.65:   ( Thu Nov 25 12:00:00 IST 2010 )
------------------------------------------------

* Replaced calls to File::Temp's tempfile() with those to its tempdir()
followed by File::Spec->catfile() - hopefully fixes the CPAN smoking failures
on Win32.

Version 2.64:   ( Sat Nov 20 11:47:07 IST 2010 )
------------------------------------------------

* Fixed https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=63177
    - tag-release.pl was installed into lib/Config by EU-MM. Converted the
    Makefile.PL to a wrapper around Build.PL by using Module-Build's
    create_makefile_pl='small' instead of create_makefile_pl='traditional' .

Version 2.63:   ( Fri Nov 19 16:50:58 IST 2010 )
------------------------------------------------

* Fixed https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=63079 by
refactoring/bug-fixing the main module into the _OutputParam method, which
handles the output of multi-line and single-line parameters with all the edge
cases.
    - The reported problem was that EOT was encountered again in certain cases
    in the output string, and now we make sure the program always avoid it. The
    reappearance of the bug was caused due to duplicate code, which was now
    eliminated.

Version 2.62:   ( Fri Nov 19 15:31:36 IST 2010 )
------------------------------------------------

* Applied a modified version of Steven Haryanto's commit
ac6ace8bf09fabba4e6ea3b2826ff13cd30507bc :
    - When writing config with fallback section, also omit the fallback
    section header, like the original file. Also, change
    t/19param-found-outside-section.t a bit to not require IO::Scalar and use
    File::Temp instead (we are testing WriteConfig anyway).
    - Shlomi Fish fixed unless'es to if's and converted a do { ... } if call to
    a block conditional, as well as made the open statements on t/19param
    more secure.

* Add -nomultiline option.
    -Applied a modified version of Steven Haryanto's commit
    2181f438d40b54c290a2dda5627a244c6e467a7b

Version 2.61:   ( Sun Nov 14 10:52:39 IST 2010 )
------------------------------------------------

* Correct the opening comment on t/26scalar-filehandle.t to point to the right
bug URL and to include the title of the bug
    - https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=54997 - this is the right
    URL.

* Correct the check in t/26scalar-filehandle.t - it should check that Perl
is above 5.8.x - not that IO::Scalar is available, because we use
open my $fh, "<", \$buffer;

Version 2.60:   ( Sat Nov 13 09:21:23 IST 2010 )
------------------------------------------------

* Made t/19param-found-outside-section.t pass in case IO::Scalar is not
installed.
    - We got many failing test reports due to that, like:
    - http://www.cpantesters.org/cpan/report/eb3df0f4-eeb7-11df-b934-9430e12b63f3

Version 2.59:   ( Fri Nov 12 13:21:02 IST 2010 )
------------------------------------------------

* Applied a patch from "sharyanto" about enabling the -fallback parameter
to new for items outside any section.
    - https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=62944

* Add the tag-release.pl file to tag a release.

Version 2.58:   ( Mon May 17 10:43:06 IDT 2010 )
------------------------------------------------

* Incorporated a fix for some broken POD.
    - https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=51617
    - Thanks to Frank Wiegand for reporting it.

* Got rid of \r/carriage-returns's in lib/Config/IniFiles.pm .
    - It interfered with applying a patch.

* Applied a patch to get rid of indirect object notation in the documentation
and code ("new Config::IniFiles") and replace it with Config::IniFiles->new().
    - https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=57536
    - Thanks to Tom Molesworth for the patch.

Version 2.57:   ( Mon Mar  1 15:49:54 IST 2010 )
------------------------------------------------

* Fixed failure to read the ini file contents from a filehandle made out of a
  scalar
    - https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=45997
    - Applied a patch by Nicolas Mendoza - thanks!

Version 2.56:   ( Thu Dec 31 06:55:01 IST 2009 )
------------------------------------------------

* Hopefully fixed the skip() in t/07misc.t
    - https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=53238
    - It was skip($num, $label) instead of skip($label, $num) and it
    lacked a "SKIP:" label.

Version 2.55:   ( Tue Dec 22 17:42:59 IST 2009 )
------------------------------------------------

* Refactoring the tests:
    - Converted t/05hash.t to Test::More and modernised it.
    - Converted t/06oo.t to Test::More and modernised it.
    - Testing: extracted t/lib/Config/IniFiles/TestPaths.pm.
    - Converted t/10delta.t to Test::More and modernised it.
    - Add the t_unlink method.

Version 2.54:   ( Wed Nov 18 12:00:44 IST 2009 )
------------------------------------------------

* Adapted t/25line-endings.t to perl-5.6.x .
    - http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/2009/11/msg6026936.html
    - Failure there.
    - did that by replacing open ">:raw" with "binmode()".

Version 2.53:   ( Fri Nov 13 11:52:40 IST 2009 )
------------------------------------------------

* Converted t/01basic.t to Test::More and modernised it.
* Converted t/02weird.t to Test::More and modernised it.
* Converted t/04import.t to Test::More and modernised it.
* Applied a patch from Steffen Heinrich (SHE) for:
    - https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=51445
    - included t/25line-endings.t
        - modified a little.

Version 2.52:   ( Sun Jun 28 16:16:09 IDT 2009 )
------------------------------------------------

* Added more keys to Build.PL (author, etc.)
* Added resources and keywords to META.yml.
* Converted t/00load.t to Test-More.
* No longer chdir()-ing into "t" in t/00load.t
* Got rid of the "new Config::IniFiles" syntax in the tests.
- replaced with Config::IniFiles->new().
- see "Perl Best Practices", "Programming Perl", 3rd Edition

Version 2.51:   ( Mon Jun  8 12:38:50 IDT 2009 )
------------------------------------------------

* Fixed "#46721: $config->exists() does not pay attention to -nocase => 1"
- https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=46721

Version 2.50:   ( Sun May 31 14:54:14 IDT 2009 )
------------------------------------------------

* Fixed the POD for SetParameterEOT:
- https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=28375
* Added t/pod.t and t/pod-coverage.t and fixed the problems they pointed:
- Removed some trailing pod.
    - http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=46549
- Documented the ->OutputConfig() method.

Version 2.49:   ( Sat May  2 17:16:28 IDT 2009 )
------------------------------------------------

* Fixed bug https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=45209 :
- Makefile.PL lacked the empty "PL_FILES" directive.

* Fixed bug https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=45588 :
- Failure to read ini file contents from a scalar (via "IO::Scalar").
- added t/23scalar-ref.t

Version 2.48:   ( Tue Apr  7 15:24:55 IDT 2009 )
------------------------------------------------

* Fixed bug https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=30402 :
- Trailing comments at the end of the file are not written.
- added a test (t/22trailing-comment-lines.t ) and a test file.

* Reverted the fix to bug #34067 ( "Multiline values returned as array
references in tied hash interface"), as it could potentially break a lot
of old code, and was not such a good idea, and was less preferable from
interface-sanity reasons.

* Documented the old API in regards to bug #34067 - see above.

Version 2.47:   ( Wed Jan 21 11:32:24 IST 2009 )
------------------------------------------------

* Fixed bug https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=34067 :
- Multiline values returned as array references in tied hash interface
- This was as opposed to the documentation.
- added t/21multiline-values-in-tied.t and fixed some older tests.

* Moved the eval'ed debugging code (_assert_invariants) to its own module,
without the eval so the perl-5.6.2 will be happy. Now explicitly use'ing it
from t/lib where appropriate. See for example:
- http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/2009/01/msg3101788.html

Version 2.46:   ( Sat Jan 17 16:31:52 IST 2009 )
------------------------------------------------

* Added regression tests for bug #1720915
- https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1720915&group_id=6926&atid=106926
- the bug seems to be fixed in trunk.

* Added a regression test for RT #36584
- https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=36584
- the bug seems to be fixed in trunk.

* Added a regression test for RT #36309
- https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=36309
- Testing for allowedcommentchars.
- the bug seems to be fixed in trunk.

* Converted t/03comments.t to Test::More and did other cleanups in preparation
of solving a few bugs.

* Now GetSectionComment does the documented behaviour in scalar context and
returns the string joined by newlines:
- https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=8612

* Now GetParameterComment returns the right thing in scalar context (joined
by newlines). It was documented and tested.
- https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=8612

Version 2.45:   ( Sat Dec 27 17:21:45 IST 2008 )
------------------------------------------------

* Fixed bug #1230339:
- https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1230339&group_id=6926&atid=106926
- Can't store and retrive "\nEOT\n"
- Fixed by checking for the existence of the here-doc terminator in the
string, and if so appending more characters.

* Fixed bug #1565180
- https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1565180&group_id=6926&atid=106926
- -nocase breaks -default.
- If a default-values section is specified, then -nocase did not look it up
if it's not lowercase.

* Fixed bug #1831654
- https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1831654&group_id=6926&atid=106926
- multiline-values are tainted.
- Added a test as t/17untainted-multiline-values.t

Version 2.44:   ( Thu Dec 25 11:44:07 IST 2008 )
------------------------------------------------

* Eliminated an assignment of $VERSION into itself to "get rid of warnings".
Only caused warnings at Build.PL, and is unnecessary now that we
"use vars".

Version 2.43:   ( Thu Dec  4 18:56:02 IST 2008 )
------------------------------------------------

* Placed IniFiles.pm under lib/Config/IniFiles.pm.

* Added a Build.PL file for the distribution.

* Moved the ChangeLog to its own file - Changes.

* Made the README contain the useful information and nothing else - previously
it was a copy of the module's entire POD.

* Added a regression test for:

https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=778593&group_id=6926&atid=106926

When copying tied-hashes representing sections with multiline values as
keys, one used to get a reference instead of a copy. This was fixed in SVN
but not in CPAN.

* Added a test for opening an empty file, inspired by:

https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=927111&group_id=6926&atid=106926

* Added a fix for this bug:

https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=767913&group_id=6926&atid=106926

With a test that I wrote myself: in list context, ->val() returned the list
containing (undef()) if there was no such key. Now returning the empty
list which evaluates to false.

* Added a test for bug

    "[ 2030786 ] Brackets within values are treated as section headers"

It seems to be fixed on SVN.

[By Proxy for domq]
* Encapsulation of internal data structures even for use within the
  class: e.g. ReadConfig() and the TIEHASH interface operate using accessor
  methods on $self. Causes massive simplification of the code.

* TIEHASH interface made load-on-demand. Order of each() in TIEHASH
  same as configuration file's order (i.e. $self->Sections() and
  $self->Parameters()).

* push() and exists() methods

* -allowempty and -deltas parameters to new()

* support for loading config from a SCALAR reference. Unfortunately
  this also requires a small patch to IO::Scalar, whose author has yet
  to respond to my email

* ->{myparms} and ->{mysects} fields, supporting -delta=>1 option to
  WriteConfig()

* _assert_invariants() method (used only in t/01basic.t and
  t/02weird.t, maybe should be packaged otherwise)

Revision 2.18  2001/03/30 04:41:08  rbowen
Small documentation change in IniFiles.pm - pod2* was choking on misplaces
=item tags. And I regenerated the README
The main reason for this release is that the MANIFEST in the 2.17 version was
missing one of the new test suite files, and that is included in this
re-release.

Revision 1.7  2000/09/21 11:19:17  rbowen
Mostly documentation changes. I moved the change log into the POD rather
than having it in a separate Changes file. This allows people to see the
changes in the Readme before they download the module. Now I just
need to make sure I remember to regenerate the Readme every time I do
a commit.


1.6 September 19, 2000 by JW, AS
* Applied several patches submitted to me by Jeremy and Alex.
* Changed version number to the CVS version number, so that I won't
have to think about changing it ever again. Big version change
should not be taken as a huge leap forward.

0.12 September 13, 2000 by JW/WADG
* Added documentation to clarify autovivification issues when
creating new sections
* Fixed version number (Oops!)

list when no groups are present (submitted by John Bass, Sep 13)

0.10 September 13, 2000 by JW/WADG

when a parameter value is undef

Hey! Where's the change log for 0.09?

0.08
2000-07-30  Adrian Phillips  <adrianp@powertech.no>

* test.pl: Fixed some tests which use $\, and made those that try
to check a non existant val check against ! defined.

* IniFiles.pm: hopefully fixed use of $\ when this is unset
(problems found when running tests with -w).  Similar problem with
$/ which can be undefined and trying to return a val which does
not exist. Modified val docs section to indicate a undef return
when this occurs.

0.07

() if the particular value is undefined.

how the internal data structure works.
* Set up a project on SourceForge. (Not a change, but worth
noting).
